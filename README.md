# Tour-de-france-Data-analytics-Project
This project analyzes historical Tour de France data using R to uncover evolving trends in race performance and structure. We examine winner demographics—nationality, age, weight, and height—alongside stage characteristics like type and distance, to trace how the race and its champions have transformed across eras.
